Sentence: Well, I
understand it, though.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9808

Sentence: Of course, I can’t explain who it is precisely

no one else.

Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0202

Sentence: I wrote it
thinking it would sound very witty; but now that I have seen myself
that I only wanted to show off in a despicable way, I will not scratch
it out on purpose!)
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2724

Sentence: When petitioners used to come for information to the table at which I
sat, I used to grind my teeth at them, and felt intense enjoyment when

that sword.

Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.4494

Sentence: But do you know, gentlemen, what was the chief point about my spite?
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3785

Sentence: Why, the whole point, the real sting of it lay in the fact that
continually, even in the moment of the acutest spleen, I was inwardly
conscious with shame that I was not only not a spiteful but not even an
embittered man, that I was simply scaring sparrows at random and
amusing myself by it.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.5520

Sentence: I might foam at the mouth, but bring me a doll to
play with, give me a cup of tea with sugar in it, and maybe I should be
appeased.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3490

Sentence: I might even be genuinely touched, though probably I should
grind my teeth at myself afterwards and lie awake at night with shame
for months after.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.5676

elements.

was ashamed: they drove me to convulsions and—sickened me, at last, how
they sickened me!

Sentence: However, I assure
you I do not care if you are....
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.7945

Sentence: It was not only that I could not become spiteful, I did not know how to
become anything; neither spiteful nor kind, neither a rascal nor an
honest man, neither a hero nor an insect.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.7167

Sentence: Now, I am living out my life
in my corner, taunting myself with the spiteful and useless consolation
that an intelligent man cannot become anything seriously, and it is
only the fool who becomes anything.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.7830

Sentence: Yes, a man in the nineteenth
century must and morally ought to be pre-eminently a characterless

creature.

vulgar, immoral.

honestly I will tell you who do: fools and worthless fellows.

all old men that to their face, all these venerable old men, all these
silver-haired and reverend seniors!

You imagine no doubt, gentlemen, that I want to amuse you.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0058

Sentence: You are
mistaken in that, too.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2595

Sentence: I am by no means such a mirthful person as you
imagine, or as you may imagine; however, irritated by all this babble
(and I feel that you are irritated) you think fit to ask me who I
am—then my answer is, I am a collegiate assessor.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1682

Sentence: I was in the service
that I might have something to eat (and solely for that reason), and

the Petersburg climate is bad for me, and that with my small means it
is very expensive to live in Petersburg.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0902

Sentence: I know all that better than
all these sage and experienced counsellors and monitors....
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.4513

remaining in Petersburg; I am not going away from Petersburg!
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0545

going away because ... ech!

many times tried to become an insect.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3995

Sentence: But I was not equal even to that.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1446

Sentence: I swear, gentlemen, that to be too conscious is an illness—a real
thorough-going illness.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1366

Sentence: For man’s everyday needs, it would have been
quite enough to have the ordinary human consciousness, that is, half or
a quarter of the amount which falls to the lot of a cultivated man of
our unhappy nineteenth century, especially one who has the fatal
ill-luck to inhabit Petersburg, the most theoretical and intentional
town on the whole terrestrial globe.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.4052

Sentence: (There are intentional and
unintentional towns.)
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2595

Sentence: It would have been quite enough, for instance, to
have the consciousness by which all so-called direct persons and men of
action live.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2473

Sentence: I bet you think I am writing all this from affectation, to
be witty at the expense of men of action; and what is more, that from
ill-bred affectation, I am clanking a sword like my officer.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3656

Sentence: But,
gentlemen, whoever can pride himself on his diseases and even swagger
over them?
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2487

Sentence: Though, after all, everyone does do that; people do pride themselves on
their diseases, and I do, may be, more than anyone.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9695

Sentence: We will not dispute
it; my contention was absurd.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2132

Sentence: But yet I am firmly persuaded that a
great deal of consciousness, every sort of consciousness, in fact, is a
disease.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9943

Sentence: I stick to that.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2758

Sentence: Let us leave that, too, for a minute.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0761

Sentence: Tell me
this: why does it happen that at the very, yes, at the very moments
when I am most capable of feeling every refinement of all that is
“sublime and beautiful,” as they used to say at one time, it would, as
though of design, happen to me not only to feel but to do such ugly
things, such that ... Well, in short, actions that all, perhaps,
commit; but which, as though purposely, occurred to me at the very time
when I was most conscious that they ought not to be committed.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2025

Sentence: The more
conscious I was of goodness and of all that was “sublime and
beautiful,” the more deeply I sank into my mire and the more ready I
was to sink in it altogether.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.6711

Sentence: But the chief point was that all this
was, as it were, not accidental in me, but as though it were bound to
be so.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3198

Sentence: It was as though it were my most normal condition, and not in
the least disease or depravity, so that at last all desire in me to
struggle against this depravity passed.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.7829

Sentence: It ended by my almost believing
(perhaps actually believing) that this was perhaps my normal condition.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.7234

Sentence: But at first, in the beginning, what agonies I endured in that
struggle!
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9379

Sentence: I did not believe it was the same with other people, and all
my life I hid this fact about myself as a secret.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.4096

Sentence: I was ashamed (even
now, perhaps, I am ashamed): I got to the point of feeling a sort of
secret abnormal, despicable enjoyment in returning home to my corner on
some disgusting Petersburg night, acutely conscious that that day I had
committed a loathsome action again, that what was done could never be
undone, and secretly, inwardly gnawing, gnawing at myself for it,
tearing and consuming myself till at last the bitterness turned into a
sort of shameful accursed sweetness, and at last—into positive real
enjoyment!
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.6330

Sentence: Yes, into enjoyment, into enjoyment!
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9465

Sentence: I insist upon that.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2993

Sentence: I
have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether
other people feel such enjoyment?
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.4671

Sentence: I will explain; the enjoyment was
just from the too intense consciousness of one’s own degradation; it
was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it
was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that there was no
escape for you; that you never could become a different man; that even
if time and faith were still left you to change into something
different you would most likely not wish to change; or if you did wish
to, even then you would do nothing; because perhaps in reality there
was nothing for you to change into.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.7474

Sentence: And the worst of it was, and the root of it all, that it was all in
accord with the normal fundamental laws of over-acute consciousness,
and with the inertia that was the direct result of those laws, and that
consequently one was not only unable to change but could do absolutely
nothing.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0505

Sentence: Thus it would follow, as the result of acute consciousness,
that one is not to blame in being a scoundrel; as though that were any
consolation to the scoundrel once he has come to realise that he
actually is a scoundrel.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2868

Sentence: But enough.... Ech, I have talked a lot of
nonsense, but what have I explained?
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0445

Sentence: How is enjoyment in this to be
explained?
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.6075

Sentence: But I will explain it.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3116

Sentence: I will get to the bottom of it!
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0454

Sentence: That
is why I have taken up my pen....
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.4233

Sentence: I, for instance, have a great deal of _amour propre_.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9567

Sentence: I am as
suspicious and prone to take offence as a humpback or a dwarf.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1053

Sentence: But upon
my word I sometimes have had moments when if I had happened to be
slapped in the face I should, perhaps, have been positively glad of it.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0596

Sentence: I say, in earnest, that I should probably have been able to discover
even in that a peculiar sort of enjoyment—the enjoyment, of course, of
despair; but in despair there are the most intense enjoyments,
especially when one is very acutely conscious of the hopelessness of
one’s position.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2558

Sentence: And when one is slapped in the face—why then the
consciousness of being rubbed into a pulp would positively overwhelm
one.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3325

Sentence: The worst of it is, look at it which way one will, it still turns
out that I was always the most to blame in everything.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0142

Sentence: And what is most
humiliating of all, to blame for no fault of my own but, so to say,
through the laws of nature.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0608

Sentence: In the first place, to blame because I am
cleverer than any of the people surrounding me.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1647

Sentence: (I have always
considered myself cleverer than any of the people surrounding me, and
sometimes, would you believe it, have been positively ashamed of it.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.8655

Sentence: At
any rate, I have all my life, as it were, turned my eyes away and never
could look people straight in the face.)
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.5061

Sentence: To blame, finally, because
even if I had had magnanimity, I should only have had more suffering
from the sense of its uselessness.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1367

Sentence: I should certainly have never been
able to do anything from being magnanimous—neither to forgive, for my
assailant would perhaps have slapped me from the laws of nature, and
one cannot forgive the laws of nature; nor to forget, for even if it
were owing to the laws of nature, it is insulting all the same.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3165

Sentence: Finally, even if I had wanted to be anything but magnanimous, had
desired on the contrary to revenge myself on my assailant, I could not
have revenged myself on any one for anything because I should certainly
never have made up my mind to do anything, even if I had been able to.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2200

Sentence: Why should I not have made up my mind?
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1713

Sentence: About that in particular I want
to say a few words.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9341

Sentence: III


With people who know how to revenge themselves and to stand up for
themselves in general, how is it done?
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3797

Sentence: Why, when they are possessed,
let us suppose, by the feeling of revenge, then for the time there is
nothing else but that feeling left in their whole being.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2179

Sentence: Such a
gentleman simply dashes straight for his object like an infuriated bull
with its horns down, and nothing but a wall will stop him.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.6203

Sentence: (By the way:
facing the wall, such gentlemen—that is, the “direct” persons and men
of action—are genuinely nonplussed.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2691

Sentence: For them a wall is not an evasion,
as for us people who think and consequently do nothing; it is not an
excuse for turning aside, an excuse for which we are always very glad,
though we scarcely believe in it ourselves, as a rule.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.7735

Sentence: No, they are
nonplussed in all sincerity.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2416

Sentence: The wall has for them something
tranquillising, morally soothing, final—maybe even something mysterious
... but of the wall later.)
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.4111

Sentence: Well, such a direct person I regard as the real normal man, as his
tender mother nature wished to see him when she graciously brought him
into being on the earth.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9029

Sentence: I envy such a man till I am green in the face.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0797

Sentence: He is stupid.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0136

Sentence: I am not disputing that, but perhaps the normal man
should be stupid, how do you know?
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1467

Sentence: Perhaps it is very beautiful, in
fact.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9942

Sentence: And I am the more persuaded of that suspicion, if one can call it
so, by the fact that if you take, for instance, the antithesis of the
normal man, that is, the man of acute consciousness, who has come, of
course, not out of the lap of nature but out of a retort (this is
almost mysticism, gentlemen, but I suspect this, too), this retort-made
man is sometimes so nonplussed in the presence of his antithesis that
with all his exaggerated consciousness he genuinely thinks of himself
as a mouse and not a man.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.5365

Sentence: It may be an acutely conscious mouse, yet it
is a mouse, while the other is a man, and therefore, et caetera, et
caetera.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9462

Sentence: And the worst of it is, he himself, his very own self, looks
on himself as a mouse; no one asks him to do so; and that is an
important point.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0194

Sentence: Now let us look at this mouse in action.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0816

Sentence: Let us
suppose, for instance, that it feels insulted, too (and it almost
always does feel insulted), and wants to revenge itself, too.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1061

Sentence: There may
even be a greater accumulation of spite in it than in _l’homme de la
nature et de la vérité_.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2013

Sentence: The base and nasty desire to vent that spite
on its assailant rankles perhaps even more nastily in it than in
_l’homme de la nature et de la vérité_.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0112

Sentence: For through his innate
stupidity the latter looks upon his revenge as justice pure and simple;
while in consequence of his acute consciousness the mouse does not
believe in the justice of it.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2037

Sentence: To come at last to the deed itself, to
the very act of revenge.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1295

Sentence: Apart from the one fundamental nastiness the
luckless mouse succeeds in creating around it so many other nastinesses
in the form of doubts and questions, adds to the one question so many
unsettled questions that there inevitably works up around it a sort of
fatal brew, a stinking mess, made up of its doubts, emotions, and of
the contempt spat upon it by the direct men of action who stand
solemnly about it as judges and arbitrators, laughing at it till their
healthy sides ache.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.8657

Sentence: Of course the only thing left for it is to dismiss
all that with a wave of its paw, and, with a smile of assumed contempt
in which it does not even itself believe, creep ignominiously into its
mouse-hole.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.5024

Sentence: There in its nasty, stinking, underground home our
insulted, crushed and ridiculed mouse promptly becomes absorbed in
cold, malignant and, above all, everlasting spite.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0405

Sentence: For forty years
together it will remember its injury down to the smallest, most
ignominious details, and every time will add, of itself, details still
more ignominious, spitefully teasing and tormenting itself with its own
imagination.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.8101

Sentence: It will itself be ashamed of its imaginings, but yet it
will recall it all, it will go over and over every detail, it will
invent unheard of things against itself, pretending that those things
might happen, and will forgive nothing.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.5453

Sentence: Maybe it will begin to revenge
itself, too, but, as it were, piecemeal, in trivial ways, from behind
the stove, incognito, without believing either in its own right to
vengeance, or in the success of its revenge, knowing that from all its
efforts at revenge it will suffer a hundred times more than he on whom
it revenges itself, while he, I daresay, will not even scratch himself.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2218

Sentence: On its deathbed it will recall it all over again, with interest
accumulated over all the years and ...
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0826

Sentence: But it is just in that cold, abominable half despair, half belief, in
that conscious burying oneself alive for grief in the underworld for
forty years, in that acutely recognised and yet partly doubtful
hopelessness of one’s position, in that hell of unsatisfied desires
turned inward, in that fever of oscillations, of resolutions determined
for ever and repented of again a minute later—that the savour of that
strange enjoyment of which I have spoken lies.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0479

Sentence: It is so subtle, so
difficult of analysis, that persons who are a little limited, or even
simply persons of strong nerves, will not understand a single atom of
it.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3673

Sentence: “Possibly,” you will add on your own account with a grin, “people
will not understand it either who have never received a slap in the
face,” and in that way you will politely hint to me that I, too,
perhaps, have had the experience of a slap in the face in my life, and
so I speak as one who knows.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.6204

Sentence: I bet that you are thinking that.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0320

Sentence: But set
your minds at rest, gentlemen, I have not received a slap in the face,
though it is absolutely a matter of indifference to me what you may
think about it.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2521

Sentence: Possibly, I even regret, myself, that I have given so
few slaps in the face during my life.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.8873

Sentence: But enough ... not another word
on that subject of such extreme interest to you.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0337

Sentence: I will continue calmly concerning persons with strong nerves who do not
understand a certain refinement of enjoyment.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1080

Sentence: Though in certain
circumstances these gentlemen bellow their loudest like bulls, though
this, let us suppose, does them the greatest credit, yet, as I have
said already, confronted with the impossible they subside at once.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9259

Sentence: The
impossible means the stone wall!
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0781

Sentence: What stone wall?
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.5488

Sentence: Why, of course, the
laws of nature, the deductions of natural science, mathematics.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.8097

Sentence: As soon
as they prove to you, for instance, that you are descended from a
monkey, then it is no use scowling, accept it for a fact.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3314

Sentence: When they
prove to you that in reality one drop of your own fat must be dearer to
you than a hundred thousand of your fellow-creatures, and that this
conclusion is the final solution of all so-called virtues and duties
and all such prejudices and fancies, then you have just to accept it,
there is no help for it, for twice two is a law of mathematics.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3742

Sentence: Just
try refuting it.
Sentiment: Negative

Sentence: They say that Cleopatra (excuse an instance from Roman
history) was fond of sticking gold pins into her slave-girls’ breasts
and derived gratification from their screams and writhings.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.6037

Sentence: You will
say that that was in the comparatively barbarous times; that these are
barbarous times too, because also, comparatively speaking, pins are
stuck in even now; that though man has now learned to see more clearly
than in barbarous ages, he is still far from having learnt to act as
reason and science would dictate.

nature and turned it in a normal direction.

Sentence: You are confident that then
man will cease from _intentional_ error and will, so to say, be
compelled not to want to set his will against his normal interests.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0789

Sentence: That is not all; then, you say, science itself will teach man (though
to my mind it’s a superfluous luxury) that he never has really had any
caprice or will of his own, and that he himself is something of the
nature of a piano-key or the stop of an organ, and that there are,
besides, things called the laws of nature; so that everything he does
is not done by his willing it, but is done of itself, by the laws of
nature.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.8303

Sentence: Consequently we have only to discover these laws of nature, and
man will no longer have to answer for his actions and life will become
exceedingly easy for him.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1052

Sentence: All human actions will then, of course, be
tabulated according to these laws, mathematically, like tables of
logarithms up to 108,000, and entered in an index; or, better still,
there would be published certain edifying works of the nature of
encyclopaedic lexicons, in which everything will be so clearly
calculated and explained that there will be no more incidents or
adventures in the world.

Sentence: I, for instance, would not be in the least surprised if all of a

gentleman with an ignoble, or rather with a reactionary and ironical,
countenance were to arise and, putting his arms akimbo, say to us all:
“I say, gentleman, hadn’t we better kick over the whole show and
scatter rationalism to the winds, simply to send these logarithms to
the devil, and to enable us to live once more at our own sweet foolish
will!” That again would not matter, but what is annoying is that he

Sentiment: Negative

Sentence: And all that

discovered a formula for all our desires and caprices—that is, an
explanation of what they depend upon, by what laws they arise, how they

that is a real mathematical formula—then, most likely, man will at once

Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.4429

Sentence: But when all that is explained and worked out on
paper (which is perfectly possible, for it is contemptible and
senseless to suppose that some laws of nature man will never

Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.6807

Sentence: For
if a desire should come into conflict with reason we shall then reason

reason and desire to injure ourselves.
Sentiment: Positive

Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2643

Sentence: But the reason why he wants sometimes to go off at a tangent may just
be that he is _predestined_ to make the road, and perhaps, too, that
however stupid the “direct” practical man may be, the thought sometimes
will occur to him that the road almost always does lead _somewhere_,
and that the destination it leads to is less important than the process
of making it, and that the chief thing is to save the well-conducted
child from despising engineering, and so giving way to the fatal

it not be that he loves chaos and destruction (there can be no
disputing that he does sometimes love it) because he is instinctively
afraid of attaining his object and completing the edifice he is
constructing?
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.7567

Sentence: Who knows, perhaps he only loves that edifice from a
distance, and is by no means in love with it at close quarters; perhaps
he only loves building it and does not want to live in it, but will
leave it, when completed, for the use of _les animaux domestiques_—such

Sentence: And who knows (there is no

is striving lies in this incessant process of attaining, in other
words, in life itself, and not in the thing to be attained, which must
always be expressed as a formula, as positive as twice two makes four,

When from dark error’s subjugation
My words of passionate exhortation
    Had wrenched thy fainting spirit free;
And writhing prone in thine affliction
Thou didst recall with malediction
    The vice that had encompassed thee:
And when thy slumbering conscience, fretting
    By recollection’s torturing flame,
Thou didst reveal the hideous setting
    Of thy life’s current ere I came:
When suddenly I saw thee sicken,
    And weeping, hide thine anguished face,
Revolted, maddened, horror-stricken,
    At memories of foul disgrace.

Sentence: Consequently these
transcendental natures are not found amongst us in their pure form.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.7630

Sentence: The
idea that they are is due to our “realistic” journalists and critics of
that day, always on the look out for Kostanzhoglos and Uncle Pyotr
Ivanitchs and foolishly accepting them as our ideal; they have
slandered our romantics, taking them for the same transcendental sort
as in Germany or France.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2721

Sentence: On the contrary, the characteristics of our
“romantics” are absolutely and directly opposed to the transcendental
European type, and no European standard can be applied to them.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.6733

Sentence: (Allow
me to make use of this word “romantic”—an old-fashioned and much
respected word which has done good service and is familiar to all.)
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0116

Sentence: The
characteristics of our romantic are to understand everything, _to see
everything and to see it often incomparably more clearly than our most
realistic minds see it;_ to refuse to accept anyone or anything, but at
the same time not to despise anything; to give way, to yield, from
policy; never to lose sight of a useful practical object (such as
rent-free quarters at the government expense, pensions, decorations),
to keep their eye on that object through all the enthusiasms and
volumes of lyrical poems, and at the same time to preserve “the sublime
and the beautiful” inviolate within them to the hour of their death,
and to preserve themselves also, incidentally, like some precious jewel
wrapped in cotton wool if only for the benefit of “the sublime and the
beautiful.” Our “romantic” is a man of great breadth and the greatest
rogue of all our rogues, I assure you....

Sentiment: Negative

Sentence: But what
am I saying!
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0406

Sentence: The romantic is always intelligent, and I only meant to
observe that although we have had foolish romantics they don’t count,
and they were only so because in the flower of their youth they
degenerated into Germans, and to preserve their precious jewel more
comfortably, settled somewhere out there—by preference in Weimar or the
Black Forest.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.5360

Sentence: I, for instance, genuinely despised my official work and did not openly
abuse it simply because I was in it myself and got a salary for it.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0644

Sentence: Anyway, take note, I did not openly abuse it.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1862

Sentence: Our romantic would rather
go out of his mind—a thing, however, which very rarely happens—than
take to open abuse, unless he had some other career in view; and he is
never kicked out.

Sentence: I was comforted by this thought even
in those days, and I am of the same opinion now.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1328

Sentence: That is why there are
so many “broad natures” among us who never lose their ideal even in the
depths of degradation; and though they never stir a finger for their
ideal, though they are arrant thieves and knaves, yet they tearfully
cherish their first ideal and are extraordinarily honest at heart.

Sentence: Yes,
it is only among us that the most incorrigible rogue can be absolutely

Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.8482

Sentence: I repeat, our romantics, frequently, become such accomplished rascals
(I use the term “rascals” affectionately), suddenly display such a
sense of reality and practical knowledge that their bewildered
superiors and the public generally can only ejaculate in amazement.

gentleman thrown out of the window—and I envied him so much that I even
went into the tavern and into the billiard-room.

intolerable humiliation at the thought, which passed into an incessant

there were any sort of public scandal (and the public there is of the
most _recherché:_ the Countess walks there; Prince D. walks there; all
the literary world is there), I must be well dressed; that inspires
respect and of itself puts us on an equal footing in the eyes of the

afterwards.

too sick.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0236

Sentence: By degrees, however, I grew used to that too.

Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.5716

Sentence: But
I had a means of escape that reconciled everything—that was to find
refuge in “the sublime and the beautiful,” in dreams, of course.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1911

Sentence: I was
a terrible dreamer, I would dream for three months on end, tucked away
in my corner, and you may believe me that at those moments I had no
resemblance to the gentleman who, in the perturbation of his chicken
heart, put a collar of German beaver on his great-coat.

were my dreams and how I could satisfy myself with them—it is hard to

Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0748

Sentence: Though, indeed,
even now, I am to some extent satisfied with them.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9771

Sentence: Dreams were
particularly sweet and vivid after a spell of dissipation; they came
with remorse and with tears, with curses and transports.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.8099

Sentence: There were
moments of such positive intoxication, of such happiness, that there
was not the faintest trace of irony within me, on my honour.

Sentence: I had
faith, hope, love.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9974

Sentence: I believed blindly at such times that by some
miracle, by some external circumstance, all this would suddenly open
out, expand; that suddenly a vista of suitable activity—beneficent,
good, and, above all, _ready made_ (what sort of activity I had no
idea, but the great thing was that it should be all ready for me)—would
rise up before me—and I should come out into the light of day, almost
riding a white horse and crowned with laurel.

contentedly occupied the lowest in reality.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1084

Sentence: Either to be a hero or to
grovel in the mud—there was nothing between.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1171

Sentence: That was my ruin, for when
I was in the mud I comforted myself with the thought that at other
times I was a hero, and the hero was a cloak for the mud: for an
ordinary man it was shameful to defile himself, but a hero was too
lofty to be utterly defiled, and so he might defile himself.
Sentiment: Negative

reminding me of themselves, but did not banish the dissipation by their
appearance.
Sentiment: Positive

Sentence: On the contrary, they seemed to add a zest to it by
contrast, and were only sufficiently present to serve as an appetising
sauce.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3192

Sentence: That sauce was made up of contradictions and sufferings, of
agonising inward analysis, and all these pangs and pin-pricks gave a
certain piquancy, even a significance to my dissipation—in fact,
completely answered the purpose of an appetising sauce.

that would have been superfluous.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9888

Sentence: Everything, however, passed
satisfactorily by a lazy and fascinating transition into the sphere of
art, that is, into the beautiful forms of life, lying ready, largely
stolen from the poets and novelists and adapted to all sorts of needs
and uses.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3779

Sentence: I, for instance, was triumphant over everyone; everyone, of
course, was in dust and ashes, and was forced spontaneously to
recognise my superiority, and I forgave them all.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.8176

Sentence: I was a poet and a
grand gentleman, I fell in love; I came in for countless millions and
immediately devoted them to humanity, and at the same time I confessed
before all the people my shameful deeds, which, of course, were not
merely shameful, but had in them much that was “sublime and beautiful”
something in the Manfred style.
Sentiment: Positive

Score: 0.4927

Sentence: Then the band would play a march, an amnesty would
be declared, the Pope would agree to retire from Rome to Brazil; then
there would be a ball for the whole of Italy at the Villa Borghese on
the shores of Lake Como, Lake Como being for that purpose transferred
to the neighbourhood of Rome; then would come a scene in the bushes,

had in my life, and I wonder at the fact myself now.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2671

Sentence: But I only went to
see him when that phase came over me, and when my dreams had reached
such a point of bliss that it became essential at once to embrace my

human being, actually existing.
Sentiment: Positive

distinguished at school, was of a quiet and equable disposition; but I
discovered in him a certain independence of character and even honesty
I don’t even suppose that he was particularly stupid.

hated me.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3298

Sentence: I knew, of course, that they must despise me now for my lack
of success in the service, and for my having let myself sink so low,
going about badly dressed and so on—which seemed to them a sign of my
incapacity and insignificance.

Sentence: In the
lower forms he had simply been a pretty, playful boy whom everybody

Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9047

Sentence: I had hated him, however, even in the lower forms, just because
he was a pretty and playful boy.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0202

Sentence: He was always bad at his lessons and
got worse and worse as he went on; however, he left with a good
certificate, as he had powerful interests.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.0117

school he came in for an estate of two hundred serfs, and as almost all
of us were poor he took up a swaggering tone among us.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.5862

Sentence: He was vulgar in
the extreme, but at the same time he was a good-natured fellow, even in
his swaggering.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.4246

honour and dignity, all but very few of us positively grovelled before
Zverkov, and the more so the more he swaggered.

Sentence: And it was not from any
interested motive that they grovelled, but simply because he had been
favoured by the gifts of nature.

accepted idea among us that Zverkov was a specialist in regard to tact
and the social graces.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2336

Sentence: This last fact particularly infuriated me.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3462

Sentence: I
hated the abrupt self-confident tone of his voice, his admiration of
his own witticisms, which were often frightfully stupid, though he was
bold in his language; I hated his handsome, but stupid face (for which
I would, however, have gladly exchanged my intelligent one), and the
free-and-easy military manners in fashion in the “’forties.” I hated
the way in which he used to talk of his future conquests of women (he
did not venture to begin his attack upon women until he had the
epaulettes of an officer, and was looking forward to them with
impatience), and boasted of the duels he would constantly be fighting.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.2751

Sentence: I remember how I, invariably so taciturn, suddenly fastened upon
Zverkov, when one day talking at a leisure moment with his
schoolfellows of his future relations with the fair sex, and growing as
sportive as a puppy in the sun, he all at once declared that he would
not leave a single village girl on his estate unnoticed, that that was
his _droit de seigneur_, and that if the peasants dared to protest he
would have them all flogged and double the tax on them, the bearded
rascals.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.5076

Sentence: Our servile rabble applauded, but I attacked him, not from
compassion for the girls and their fathers, but simply because they
were applauding such an insect.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.6185

Sentence: I got the better of him on that
occasion, but though Zverkov was stupid he was lively and impudent, and
so laughed it off, and in such a way that my victory was not really
complete; the laugh was on his side.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.7311

Sentence: He got the better of me on several
occasions afterwards, but without malice, jestingly, casually.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.5285

Sentence: I
remained angrily and contemptuously silent and would not answer him.
Sentiment: Negative

I was flattered, but we soon parted and quite naturally.

heard of his barrack-room success as a lieutenant, and of the fast life
he was leading.

Score: 0.5012

Sentence: Then there came other rumours—of his successes in the
service.
Sentiment: Negative

he was thirty he would be corpulent.

Score: 0.1509

Sentence: So it was to this Zverkov that my
schoolfellows were going to give a dinner on his departure.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1191

Sentence: They had
kept up with him for those three years, though privately they did not
consider themselves on an equal footing with him, I am convinced of
that.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9634

Sentence: Of Simonov’s two visitors, one was Ferfitchkin, a Russianised German—a
little fellow with the face of a monkey, a blockhead who was always
deriding everyone, a very bitter enemy of mine from our days in the
lower forms—a vulgar, impudent, swaggering fellow, who affected a most
sensitive feeling of personal honour, though, of course, he was a
wretched little coward at heart.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.4785

Sentence: He was one of those worshippers of
Zverkov who made up to the latter from interested motives, and often
borrowed money from him.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.5834

Sentence: Simonov’s other visitor, Trudolyubov, was a
person in no way remarkable—a tall young fellow, in the army, with a
cold face, fairly honest, though he worshipped success of every sort,
and was only capable of thinking of promotion.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1311

Sentence: He was some sort of
distant relation of Zverkov’s, and this, foolish as it seems, gave him
a certain importance among us.
Sentiment: Negative

whatever; his behaviour to me, though not quite courteous, was
tolerable.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.8908

Sentence: “Well, with seven roubles each,” said Trudolyubov, “twenty-one roubles
between the three of us, we ought to be able to get a good dinner.

Sentence: Zverkov, of course, won’t pay.”

“Of course not, since we are inviting him,” Simonov decided.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.3435

some insolent flunkey boasting of his master the General’s decorations,
“can you imagine that Zverkov will let us pay alone?
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.6948

Sentence: He will accept
from delicacy, but he will order half a dozen bottles of champagne.”

“Do we want half a dozen for the four of us?” observed Trudolyubov,
taking notice only of the half dozen.
Sentiment: Negative
Score: 0.1246

Sentence: “So the three of us, with Zverkov for the fourth, twenty-one roubles,
at the Hôtel de Paris at five o’clock tomorrow,” Simonov, who had been
asked to make the arrangements, concluded finally.
Sentiment: Positive
Score: 0.9072

Sentence: “How twenty-one roubles?” I asked in some agitation, with a show of
being offended; “if you count me it will not be twenty-one, but
twenty-eight roubles.”

It seemed to me that to invite myself so suddenly and unexpectedly
would be positively graceful, and that they would all be conquered at
once and would look at me with respect.
Sentiment: Negative

pleasure, seeming to avoid looking at me.

I retorted in a shaking voice, as though something tremendous had
happened.
Sentiment: Positive

look at me; with what impudent rudeness the insect Ferfitchkin would
snigger at me in order to curry favour with Zverkov; how completely

Sentence: What is more, even in
the acutest paroxysm of this cowardly fever, I dreamed of getting the

humiliating for me was that I knew even then, knew fully and for
